#Exercise 3: Numbers and Math

#Prints what I'm doing.
print "I will now count my chickens:"

#Counts Hens and Roosters by doing math!
print "Hens", 25.0 + 30 / 6
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

#What I'm doing next
print "I will now count the eggs:"

#printing the outcome of this math problem
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

#Printing a line that's asking a questing
print "Is it ture that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

#Answering the question
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

#Breaking the question down to understand the answer
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7

#More line printing
print "Oh, that's why it's False."

#More line printing 
print "How about some more."

#Testing each math symbol
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2 
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2 
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
